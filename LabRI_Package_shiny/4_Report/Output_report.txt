Welcome to the 4_Report Directory

This directory, named "4_Report", serves as the designated output folder for reports generated by the LabRI Tool. Upon running the LabRI Shiny application, this folder will house the HTML report containing the estimation and verification of reference intervals performed using the LabRI methodology.

Thank you for using the LabRI Tool!
